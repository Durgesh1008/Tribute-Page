        <p class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
            centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
            father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a
            housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
            Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one
            sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
            numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil
            Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
            trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
            pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914,
            however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the
            ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell
            newspapers to add to the family's meager income. <br><br>

            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had
            a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics. After completing his
            education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's
            College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics
            in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of
            Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack
            of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three
            days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress
            and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a
            fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

        <p class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
            Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government
            of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He
            started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at
            DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. He was
            interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket
            Launching Station (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation
            (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
            successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on
            an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's
            approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
            Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati <br><br>

            In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center
            in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an
            effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be
            successful. <br><br>

            Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
            representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also
            directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from
            the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime
            Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers
            under Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the
            true nature of these classified aerospace projects. His research and educational leadership brought him
            great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile
            programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to
            the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal
            for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after
            another.[30] R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion
            for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the
            chief executive.[30] Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni,
            an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the
            projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns. <br><br>

            Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during
            this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief
            Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of
            Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist. However, the director of
            the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for
            issuing an incorrect report. Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims. <br><br>

            In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju
            Stent". In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was
            named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet"

        <div class="vgg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by
            three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 – 7 March 2021),
            Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995). He was extremely close to his elder siblings and
            their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older
            relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.

            Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He never owned a television, and was
            in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included
            his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no will,
            and his possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him

    <div class="conta" id="more">

        <p class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at
            the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some
            discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five
            minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical
            condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the
            intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His
            last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"

            Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati,
            from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight
            landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime
            Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces,
            who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag
            and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage,
            including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul
            Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

            On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown
            to Madurai in an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was
            received at the airport by the three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet
            ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya,
            K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to
            the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving
            at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to allow the public
            to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.

            On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state
            honours. Over 350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil
            Nadu and the chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.

            Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities. The Government of India honoured him
            with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role
            as a scientific advisor to the Government. In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the
            Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in
            India. In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to
            recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".

            In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.

            Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced that his
            birthday, 15 October, would be observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the state government
            further instituted the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award", constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a certificate
            and ₹500,000 (US$6,300). The award will be awarded annually on Independence Day, beginning in 2015, to
            residents of the state with achievements in promoting scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of
            students.
