            <p>
                Moose Wala had a lot of attachment to his village Moosa, so he used to stay in his village. When he was
                alive, his fans used to visit his village everyday to meet him. He was very attached to his
                grandmother. He kept his hair at the behest of his grandmother, which was very important in Sikhism,
                because his father could not keep his hair due to an accident. <br><br>

                According to artists like Afsana Khan, Gippy Grewal, Amrit Maan, Moose Wala's personality was totally
                different from his songs. In real life he was a down to earth person. <br><br>

            <h4>controversy</h4>
            Moose Wala had a rivalry with Karan Aujla; both have replied to each other through songs, social media
            handles, and live performances. Also, both have been criticised for songs promoting violence.
            Elly Mangat, both Moose Wala's and Aujla's then-colleague, in an interview disclosed that the dispute
            between both began when Sidhu's video targeting Aujla in his song was leaked to Aujla's management, and they
            threatened to attack Sidhu. Following the incident, both started targeting each other on social
            media. The rivalry was resolved temporarily until Aujla released a diss-track, "Lafaafe", followed
            by Sidhu's "Warning Shot" Aujla in an interview stated that he did not write the track "Lafaafe" and
            did not reveal anything about their rivalry, but praised Moose Wala's work.[81] After Moose Wala's death,
            Aujla paid tribute with the song "Maa"

            <p>
                At the time of his death, Moose Wala was facing criminal charges for promoting gun culture and violence.
                Two of the charges were related to obscene scenes. <br><br>
                In May 2020, two videos featuring Moose Wala went viral on social media: one showcased him training to
                use an AK-47 with assistance from police officers, and the other saw him use a personal pistol.
                The six officers who had assisted him were suspended following the incident. On 19 May, he was
                booked under two sections of the Arms Act. The police began conducting raids to find Moose Wala, but
                he absconded to evade arrest. On 2 June, the Barnala District Court rejected a plea for
                anticipatory bail for Moose Wala and five accused officers. <br><br>
                On 6 June 2020, he was fined by police in Nabha because his car windows were tinted black beyond what
                was permissible and was allowed to leave despite being under lookout; Moose Wala incorrectly told the
                officers that he was already on bail. In July, he joined the police investigation and was granted
                regular bail. That month, he released a single titled "Sanju", comparing himself to actor Sanjay
                Dutt, who was also arrested under the Arms Act.[93] Indian sport shooter Avneet Sidhu criticised the
                song and called out Moose Wala for promoting gun culture. The next day, a case was registered
                against him for releasing the song. In an interview, Moose Wala alleged that he was being
                deliberately targeted by some news channels and lawyers. <br><br>

            <p>
                Moose Wala actively campaigned for his mother, Charan Kaur, who won the sarpanch election from Moosa
                village in December 2018. <br><br>


                Moose Wala joining Indian National Congress in presence of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and
                PPCC President Navjot Singh Sidhu. <br><br>
                On 3 December 2021, Moose Wala joined the Indian National Congress to contest the 2022 Punjab
                Legislative Assembly election. Nazar Singh Manshahia, the Congress MLA from Mansa, revolted
                and opposed Moose Wala's candidacy. Obtaining only 20.52% votes from the Mansa constituency, Moose
                Wala lost to Aam Aadmi Party's Vijay Singla by a margin of 63,323 votes. <br><br>

                During the 2022 election, a case under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code was filed against Moose Wala
                for his violation of the election code of conduct. He had held a door-to-door campaign in the Mansa
                constituency after the end of the allowed duration of the election campaign. <br><br>

                On 11 April 2022, Moose Wala released a song titled "Scapegoat", in which he laments his failure in the
                2022 Punjab state assembly elections. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) claimed that Moose Wala through his
                song insinuated that the voters of Punjab were "gaddar" (transl. traitors) for electing the AAP. They
                also claimed that Moose Wala's song perpetuates the Indian National Congress' "anti-Punjab" mentality
                and demanded an answer from the party's state unit president, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, on whether he
                endorsed Moose Wala's views. <br><br>

            <p>
                Moose Wala was shot dead by unidentified assailants in his car on 29 May 2022 in Jawaharke village of
                Mansa district. According to police, the Lawrence Bishnoi gang initially claimed responsibility for the
                murder in an unverified Facebook post, which Bishnoi denied making, but is being held by the Punjab
                Police as of June 2022 and is considered the "mastermind" by officials in the murder. <br><br>

                According to police, at around 4:30 pm, Sidhu Moose Wala left his house with his cousin Gurpreet Singh
                and neighbor Gurwinder Singh. Moose Wala was driving his black Mahindra Thar SUV. He was going to his
                aunt's house in Barnala. At 5:30 when the SUV reached the village Jawaharke, two other cars
                intercepted and blocked it. Thirty rounds were fired during the incident, which also injured two
                other men. Moose Wala also fired back at the attackers using his pistol. After the shootout, the
                attackers left the scene. His father took Moose Wala to the civil hospital in Mansa, where he was
                declared dead. <br><br>

                Moose Wala was among the 424 people whose police security was reduced or entirely removed the day
                before, in preparation for the anniversary of Operation Blue Star, leaving him with two commandos only,
                as compared to four earlier. At the time of the incident, Moose Wala was travelling in his
                private car accompanied by two others instead of his bullet-proof vehicle with the police
                commandos. According to his friends, Moose Wala did not take his security along with him, as
                his Thar SUV that he chose to drive could not accommodate five people. <br><br>
